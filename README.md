## f5n

Motivated from [f5p](https://github.com/hasindu2008/f5p) - we build a network of mobiles to process [ONT](https://nanoporetech.com/) data. The work is under construction! 

### Overview
f5n can run the following on ARM devices [more details](https://hasindu2008.github.io/linux-tools-on-phone/)

 1. [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) sequence alignment
 2. [samtools](https://github.com/samtools/samtools) sort
 3. [samtools](https://github.com/samtools/samtools) index
 4. [f5c](https://github.com/hasindu2008/f5c) index
 5. [f5c](https://github.com/hasindu2008/f5c) call-methylation
 6. [f5c](https://github.com/hasindu2008/f5c) event alignment

We build a standalone application and a cluster of nodes where a master orchestrates the other nodes. 
In this way ONT data can be corrected for errors in the field, on the fly!

### Getting started
This is a quick start. To contribute to our work please refer [How to contribute](#how-to-contribute). Chose `ARCHITECTURE` to be `armeabi-v7a` or `arm64-v8a`. To find what is the `ARCHITECTURE` of your phone the easiest way is to google it. Once you download the apk copy it to your phone and install. 
```sh
VERSION=0.0.2
ARCHITECTURE=armeabi-v7a
wget "https://github.com/SanojPunchihewa/f5n/releases/download/$VERSION/mobilegenomics-f5n-v$VERSION-$ARCHITECTURE-release.apk"
```

### How to contribute
